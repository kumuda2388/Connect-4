# Connect-4
This mini project is a simulation of Funskool's connect 4 game using C++, an object-oriented programming language.
Connect Four is a two-player strategy game played on a 7-column by 6-row board. Each player has a coloured disk and drops his disk into one column. The disc falls down to the lowest empty cell of the column. The first player to make an alignment of four discs of his colour either vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins.
The program uses various concepts of Object Oriented Programming such as Message Passing, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Default Constructor, Friend Function and File Handling concepts.
